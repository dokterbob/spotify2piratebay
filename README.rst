** Artists and other copyright holders who feel left out: you should have and
should allow your fans to give you money. Straight away. No record companies,
no DRM, no hassles. If you want to talk to me about a sensible replacement for
copyright, you are welcome. But first make sure we can *directly* give you
money rather than having to pay some of the terrorists in the music industry. **

** To Spotify: make your client as fast as my local server, again. Make sure
the iOS and Android clients run as smoothly as the Symbian client. Remove the
Facebook requirement. Communicate how large a cut actually gets to the artists.
You have had, in the past, a sublime product and actually got me to pay for
music. Your service level as declined. The application is as large and lump
as iTunes right now. Sorry. **

** NOTE: You need to be a premium user to use this service **
